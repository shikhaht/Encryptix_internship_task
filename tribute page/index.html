                    <h1>Introduction:</h1>
                <p><strong id="title">Narendra Damodardas Modi</strong>, born 17th September 1950 is an Indian politician who is 
                the 14th and current Prime Minister of India, in office since May 2014. He was the Chief Minister
                 of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Modi, a member of the 
                 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is a Hindu nationalist and member of the right-wing Rashtriya 
                 Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).</p>
                 <p>Born to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child, and later ran his 
                own stall. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. 
                He left home after graduating from school, partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected. Modi traveled 
                around India for two years, and visited a number of religious centres. He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad 
                in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the 
                country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several 
                positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.
                 </p>
                 <p>Modi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public 
        image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has 
        been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots, or otherwise criticised for its handling of it, although a court found 
        no evidence to prosecute Modi. His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received 
        praise,[8] and several industrial projects were begun during his tenure. His administration has been criticised for failing 
        to significantly improve health, poverty, and education indices in the state.</p>

                    <p class="top-buffer2">On 26th May 2014 Narendra Modi took oath as the Prime Minister of India, becoming the first ever PM to be 
                    born after India attained Independence. <strong>Dynamic, dedicated and determined, Narendra Modi reflects the aspiration 
                    and hope of over a billion Indians.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Through innovative ideas and initiatives, the Government has ensured that the wheels of progress move at 
                    rapid pace and the fruits of development reach every citizen. Governance has become open, easier and transparent.</strong></p>
                    <p>In a first, the <strong>Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana</strong> marked a paradigm shift in ensuring that every citizen is integrated 
                    in the financial system of the Nation. His clarion call for <strong>‘Make in India’</strong> complimented by a focus on making business 
                    easy has stimulated unprecedented vigour and enterprise among investors and entrepreneurs. Labour reforms and dignity of 
                    labour under the <strong>‘Shrameva Jayate’</strong> initiative has empowered several workers of small and medium industries, also providing 
                    a boost to our skilled youth.</p>
                    <p>On 2nd October 2014, Mahatma Gandhi’s Birth Anniversary the PM launched <strong>‘Swachh Bharat Mission’</strong> a mass movement for 
                    cleanliness across the Nation. The scale and impact of the movement is historic</p>
                    <p>Several world leaders including Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott, President Xi Jinping of People’s Republic of China, 
                    President Maithripala Sirisena of Sri Lanka, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany have visited 
                    India and these visits have achieved breakthroughs in improving cooperation between India and these Nations. The 2015 Republic Day saw 
                    President Barack Obama visit India as the Chief Guest, a first in the history of <strong>India-USA</strong> relations. In August 2015, India hosted the 
                    <strong>FIPIC Summit</strong>, which was attended by top leaders from the Pacific Islands. Key aspects relating to India’s ties with the Pacific Islands 
                    were discussed.</p>
                    <p>Narendra Modi is a <strong>‘People’s Leader’</strong>, dedicated solving their problems and improving their well-being. Nothing is more satisfying to 
                        him than being amongst the people, sharing their joys and alleviating their sorrows. His powerful <strong>‘personal connect’</strong> with the people 
                        on ground is complemented by a strong online presence. He is known as <strong>India’s most techno-savvy leader</strong>, using the web to reach people 
                        and bring about change in their lives. He is very active on social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, 
                        Sound Cloud, Linkedin, Weibo and other forums.</p>
                    <p>Beyond politics, Narendra Modi enjoys writing. He has authored several books, including poetry. He begins his day with yoga, which centers his 
                    body and mind and instills the power of calmness in an otherwise fast-paced routine.</p>
                    <p>This is the man, an embodiment of courage, compassion and conviction, on whom the nation has bestowed its mandate, trusting that he will 
                        rejuvenate India and make it a bright beacon to the world.</p>
